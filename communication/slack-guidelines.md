# Slack Guidelines

Slack is the preferred communication platform in DIPS.

## Code of Conduct
- Be respectful and nice.
- Use smileys to convey your emotions. Irony translates poorly into text only.
- The primary language in most channels is Norwegian. For the `dev` channel and channels dedicated to cooperation with English speakers, the primary language is English. For developer centric channels, prefer English.

## Profile
- Your profile must contain the following information:
	- Display name: DIPS username
	- Your full name
	- A recognisable picture of yourself
	- Email: your dips.no address
	- What I do: Team or department and a sentence about you

## Channels
- Prefer public channels over private. Contact an administrator if you need to create a private channel.
- Administrators can be found in `#admins`.
- Prefer questions in relevant public channels over DMs. Your questions are seldom unique.
- Every product should have a corresponding public Slack channel.
- Use team channels for non-product stuff. Team channels should start with _team_.
- Only use `@here` if itâ€™s absolutely vital that the entire channel sees your message as soon as possible.
- Never use `@channel`.
- Write using the primary language of the channel. 

## Messages
- Reply to messages using threads.
- Use reactions instead messages if you just want to signal agreement/disagreement.
- When asking a question, react with a checkmark if the question when the question has been answered in the thread below.
- Use quotations, verbatim and code formatting to make your messages as readable as possible.
- Reply or comment in the same language as the original message.

## DMs
- If you have question, write it in the first message. No need to start with _hi_ only.

## Tips & Tricks
- Turn on `Full & display names` to see the full names of people on Slack and not just their display name.
- Use `CTRL (Command) + K` to navigate to or search for anything.
